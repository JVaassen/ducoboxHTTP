## Description

This package contains the Node-Red flow to grab information of your DucoBox. It will only work if you have the communication print installed. 

## Install

To install the stable version use the `Menu - Manage palette` option and search for `ducoboxhttp`, or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`:

    npm install ducoboxhttp

Add your IP-adres in de node and the node-ID you want to read. You can look up the node-ID by accessing your ducobox on http://IPADRESDUCOBOX
